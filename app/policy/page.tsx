          believe that the personal information of the participants should not
          be shared with third parties without the prior consent or request from

          Mahalingeshwara Temple, the information of the participants such as
          contact number, email, addresses, etc., is used only for internal
          purposes. Your contact information is stored in our database and is
          only used to contact you during the course of your stay with us for
          sharing the status of your room bookings and for announcing our latest
          scientific information, etc. We at Shree Harihareshwara Temple condemn
          the unauthorized reach and misuse and/or disclosure of the personal

          high security features to prevent the same. Any changes in our Privacy
          Policy will be posted here on the website.
